This directory contains Dockerfiles for building and testing ccache in different
build environments. These are unofficial Dockerfiles only intended for use by
ccache developers locally.

For instance, run something like this to build ccache in Ubuntu 24.04:

    misc/build-in-docker ubuntu-24.04

The above command will first build the Ubuntu 24.04 Docker image if needed and
finally build ccache and run the ccache test suite.

See also misc/test-some-systems.
